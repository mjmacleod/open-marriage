We're excited that you'll be attending our wedding and we're looking forward to seeing you in three short weeks!

On Sunday morning after the wedding, an informal brunch buffet will be served at the home of Steve and Minda Goldberg (the same location as the wedding). Stop by anytime between 11am - 1pm, before you head out of town.
