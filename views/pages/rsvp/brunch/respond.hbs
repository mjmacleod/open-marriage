        An informal buffet of bagels and fixings will be served at the home of Steve and Minda Goldberg (the same location as the wedding) on <b>Sunday morning</b>. Stop by anytime between 11am and 1pm, before you head out of town.

    <p>
        We would appreciate if you would RSVP, <b>regrets only</b>, if you know you <em>won't</em> be attending the brunch.
